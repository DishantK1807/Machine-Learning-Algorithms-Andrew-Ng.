#Multivariate Linear Regression Sample Implementation

- Investigating multivariate linear regression using gradient descent and the normal equations. 
- Also examining the relationship between the cost function `J(theta)`, the convergence of gradient descent, and the learning rate `alpha`.
- The training set is of housing prices in Portland, Oregon, where the outputs `y(i)` are the prices and the inputs `x(i)` are the living area and the number of bedrooms. 
- There are `m=47` training examples.
