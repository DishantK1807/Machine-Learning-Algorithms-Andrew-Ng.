#Linear Regression : Definition
- Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 
- One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.

## Sample Implementation

- The sample data set contains some example measurements of heights for various boys between the ages of two and eights. 
- The y-values are the heights measured in meters, and the x-values are the ages of the boys corresponding to the heights
- Each height and age tuple constitutes one training example  `(x(i), y(i))` in our dataset. 
- There are `m = 50` training examples which are used to develop a linear regression model.
- `linear_regression_using_gradient_descent.m` contains the code which accesses the dataset files `ex2x.txt` and `ex2y.txt`.
