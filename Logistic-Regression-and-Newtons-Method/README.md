# Logistic Regression and Newton's Method

*Using Newton's Method to implement logistic regression on a classification problem.*

### Sample Implementation

- The dataset represents 40 high school students who were admitted to college and 40 students who were not admitted. 
- Each  `{x(i), y(i)}` training example contains a student's score on two standardized exams and a label of whether the student was admitted.
- The first column of your x array represents all Test 1 scores, and the second column represents all Test 2 scores.
- The y vector uses '1' to label a student who was admitted and '0' to label a student who was not admitted.
- The task is to build a binary classification model that estimates college admission chances based on a student's scores on two exams.
